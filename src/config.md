- In windows in file paths you need to replace `\` with `\\` e.g. `"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Dia\\bin\\diaw.exe"` 
- On Windows I didn't use Java from Oracle but AdeptOpenJDK. I set the environment variables that freeplane wants, see https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Command-line_options_and_configuration. Still couldn't run the windows executable. But I can run `java -jar c:\Program Files\Freeplane\freeplanelauncher.jar`. If I put `java -jar c:\\Program Files\\Freeplane\\freeplanelauncher.jar` into the config of this add-on as `image_diagram_mindmap__freeplane_path` it doesn't work. subprocess complains about a missing file. So I made a script `freeplane.bat` which is in my PATH which contains just one line `java -jar "c:\Program Files\Freeplane\freeplanelauncher.jar" %*`.
